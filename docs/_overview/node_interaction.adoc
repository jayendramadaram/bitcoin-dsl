The DSL makes it easy to interact with bitcoin node with complete
contract state available.

---

The DSL supports all
link:https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/API_reference_%28JSON-RPC%29[ JSON-RPC
API commands] supported by bitcoin. You don't need to worry about
(de)serialization of arguments. Just provide the transaction object or
any other parameter directly from the DSL. Here are a few examples:

[source,ruby]
----
@address = ...

# Mine blocks to the address
generatetoaddress num_blocks: 100, to: @address

@tx = ...

# Send raw transaction
sendrawtransaction tx: @tx
----

Apart from providing access to the raw JSON-API commands, the DSL also
provides commands that use the JSON-API to make life easier for a
contract developer. For example, there are commands to extend chain
and finding a spendable UTXO controlled by a key.

See details under link:../dev/reference.html#node-interaction[Node Interaction under Reference]
for details.
