= Lighting contracts without anchors

These contracts ignore the fees calculation, the dust limits and the
trimming of transactions. The purpose of these scripts is to show how
a complex lifecycle of transactions as observed in LN can be captured
with Bitcoin DSL.

These scripts also ignore the key derivation for various roles. We
initially generate a bunch of keys to fulfill the various roles.

* [x] Funding transaction
* [x] Commitment transaction without anchors
** [x] To Local
** [x] To Remote
** [ ] Cooperative close (HTLCs settled or not added)
** [ ] Add HTLCs
*** [ ] HTLCs Offered
*** [ ] HTLCs Received
** [ ] Cooperative close after settling HTLCs
* [ ] HTLC Timeout & Success
* [ ] Revocation of commitments
* [ ] Closing Transaction
